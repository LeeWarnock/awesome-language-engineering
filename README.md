### [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) 
A powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

### [MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) (Meta Programming System)

With JetBrains MPS, you can define custom editors for any new language and make using these DSLs simpler. Even domain experts, who are not familiar with traditional programming, can easily work in MPS with domain-specific languages designed around their domain-specific terminology.
