# Tools
### [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) 
A powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

### [MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) (Meta Programming System)

With JetBrains MPS, you can define custom editors for any new language and make using these DSLs simpler. Even domain experts, who are not familiar with traditional programming, can easily work in MPS with domain-specific languages designed around their domain-specific terminology.

[The MPS Language Workbench Volume I](https://www.amazon.com/MPS-Language-Workbench-Programming-System/dp/153053335X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505363569&sr=8-1&keywords=jetbrains+MPS):  a simple introduction to the JetBrains MPS language workbench and a complete reference manual

[The MPS Language Workbench Volume II](https://www.amazon.com/MPS-Language-Workbench-II-Programming/dp/1532805373/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1505363569&sr=8-2&keywords=jetbrains+MPS): how to customize the MPS platform to better integrate it with the needs of your languages

### [Xtext](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/)

Xtext is a framework for development of programming languages and domain-specific languages. With Xtext you define your language using a powerful grammar language. As a result you get a full infrastructure, including parser, linker, typechecker, compiler as well as editing support for Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA and your favorite web browser.

*Learning materials*:

[Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Specific-Languages-Xtext-Xtend-ebook/dp/B01CSLI6HM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505686814&sr=8-1&keywords=xtext): learn how to implement a DSL with Xtext and Xtend using easy-to-understand examples and best practices


### [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) and [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

Flex and Bison are aging unix utilities that help you write very fast parsers for almost arbitrary file formats. Lex and Yacc are the original tools; Flex and Bison are their almost completely compatible newer versions.

*Learning materials*:

[Flex & Bison Tutorial](http://aquamentus.com/flex_bison.html): this webpage is supposed to be a tutorial for complete novices needing to use Flex and Bison for some real project.

[Flex & Bison](https://www.amazon.com/flex-bison-Text-Processing-Tools/dp/0596155972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505766504&sr=8-1&keywords=flex+and+bison): explains how to use flex and bison to solve your problems quickly. This is the update from the original Lex & Yacc book described below.

[Lex & Yacc](https://www.amazon.com/lex-yacc-Doug-Brown/dp/1565920007/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505766519&sr=8-1&keywords=lex+and+yacc): shows you how to use two Unix utilities, lex andyacc, in program development. These tools help programmers build compilers and interpreters, but they also have a wider range of applications.
